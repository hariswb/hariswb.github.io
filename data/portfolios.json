This simple module is a python implementation of a locus based genetic algorithm for community detection. This algorithm is particularly good at detecting communities in which we don't know their number beforehand. This algorithm finds communities by its structure: it classifies densely connected nodes into a group. Although it runs slowly, this algorithm will help us in preliminary analysis of a social network."
